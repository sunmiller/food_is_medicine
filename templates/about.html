                    <p>Hello, My name is Suriyaa Sabaribala. I am a high school student at Athens High School in Troy
                        Michigan.</p>
                </div>

            <p>My father and grandmother were diagnosed with Diabetes. My dad continued to eat fried banana chips since
                he was under the impression that fried food did not affect diabetes. Since fried banana chips did not
                have carbohydrates.</p>

            <p>I researched on the internet and told him that this was not right and fried banana chips were not good
                for diabetes. He asked me to prove it. This started my journey into food and the impact of food intake
                on diabetes and hypertension.</p>

            <p>I started to create a journal with the names of the foods and their glycemic index so that my grandma and
                dad could easily refer to it. I started with simple fruits vegetables and grains. Later I expanded to
                prepared food like whole wheat bread and cake and other varieties. My dad then said that he wanted this
                in an excel spreadsheet. I made an excel spreadsheet with the food items and
                and the glycemic index and other nutritional values. </p>

            <p>I wanted to create a website that others can easily look up foods that they eat on a regular basis. My
                website should be able to make a recommendation based on the glycemic index and other nutritional values
                of the food and other dishes. This will allow the user to figure out if the food is good for them and
                their condition.</p>

            <p>Most of the nutritional values comes from the University of Sydney, the USDA and other sources on the
                internet.</p>
